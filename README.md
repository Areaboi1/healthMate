# HealthMate
## The App

Imagine having an app that makes you feel like it cares for you! An app that covers nearly every aspect of your health. Introducing HealthMate, our solution to your health problems.

## Whats's next

In future versions of HealthMate, we intend to create an independent app that can run on its own and bring our static concepts to life. In addition, we plan to add a feature that allows users to book appointments with various clinics and doctors. Currently, there is a small market for this idea as many clinics, hospitals, and doctors still use traditional methods such as making phone calls and using their calendars. By using our app, patients can directly schedule appointments, freeing up receptionists to attend to patients at the clinic rather than managing calls and patients simultaneously. Another feature we will add to the app is an auto-generated dietary plan that is based on user input such as height, weight, allergies, and other conditions. This plan will change weekly and provide the best alternatives for certain food items in the event they are unavailable at home. This will make it easier for users to find a one-stop solution for their dietary needs. In the future, we plan to integrate our platform with Fitbit to enable users to track their daily health statistics and view the data in graphical form. Additionally, we plan to use collective, anonymous user data to conduct health studies and research that could potentially benefit hospitals by providing them with insights into changing patterns and trends.
